# DeepCLSMOTE: Deep Class-Latent Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique

  This repository contains the code for the DeepCLSMOTE method, a deep learning-based image augmentation technique designed to address class imbalance in multi-class image classification. It extends the DeepSMOTE approach by explicitly optimizing the latent space using class centroids, leading to improved class separability and classification performance.

## Requirements:
PyTorch   
NumPy  
scikit-learn  

## Usage:
- Data preparation (transforms to tensor& gets imbalanced distribution).  
- Training Simple CNN with imbalanded dataset without autmentation then testing.  
- Training the DeepCLSMOTE model with imbalanced.   
- Generating synthetic samples based DeepSMOTE trained.  
- Training Simple CNN with balanded dataset then testing.  
- Evaluating the model is repeated via train-test datasets.  

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FaiHomjandee/DeepCLSMOTE.git
cd DeepCLSMOTE
pip install -r requirements.txt
